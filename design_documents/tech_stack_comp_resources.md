# Technology used in this project and computing requirements

I will use a simple text editor (Sublime) to write the code and the python interpreter to run the code
I will use a build tools later on to create a bundle that I can share with the community

  - Chip:	Apple M2
  - Total Number of Cores:	8 (4 performance and 4 efficiency)
  - Memory:	16 GB
  - Storage: 350/500 GB
